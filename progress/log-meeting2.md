## Work Done Since Last Meeting
* You can now pause an the running of an algorithm

* Stepping through an algorithm has been added
    * When playing an algorithm, pause to be able to "Step Back" and "Step Forward" through the steps of the algorithm

* There is now a slider to change the speed of the execution in real-time

* Logging information is now shown (Step and Line numbers)

* Heavy refactoring of old code to allow easier adding of new algorithms in the future
    * Due to these changes, I've added the functionality to change the algorithm shown on the fly with a dropdown menu

* Continuous integration has been added to the Github project
    * Look under Actions at https://github.com/liamlau/individual-project/actions to see every push being built and tested

* Issues have been added to Github to allow me to track what I'm working on, and what I need to do
