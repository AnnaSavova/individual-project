# To-Do

- make the slider smoother
- make the corresponding man/woman highlighted (boldened) when they are in focus
- going past 9 on the slider makes it shift a bit
- spamming play makes it go faster
- clean up the code

# Done
- make the selected line update with the slider
- invert the slider (slow on left, fast on right)

# To-Do (28/01/21)
- Make what I currently have as responsive as possible
    - Need to think about the max size of the canvas
    - Also think about the size of circles, and updating the position of everything in an object in the service

- Link all of the stuff I already have into the current app (description, code, playback)
    - For the code, make a container appear when the button is pressed (then make the button change to Hide Code - vice versa as well)
    - Then, have numbers of the left of each line
    - Then make sure the highlighting of lines works correctly
    - Then, make it responsive

- Make the info icon a button that leads to a popup that tells the user about the app
- Fix the format of the title
- Make clicking the logo go back home
    - Make hovering over the logo darken it slightly

- Fix tests
    - Do more unit tests
    - Do more e2e tests

# Done (28/01/21)
- Change the colour of the right hand side circles to purple (look on Figma for the hex)
- Make functions for drawing circles and lines between circles
