# To-Do

- make the slider smoother
- make the corresponding man/woman highlighted (boldened) when they are in focus
- going past 9 on the slider makes it shift a bit
- spamming play makes it go faster
- clean up the code

# Done
- make the selected line update with the slider
- invert the slider (slow on left, fast on right)
