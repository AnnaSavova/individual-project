# Bugs

Here I'll keep a log of all of the bugs I find that I'll fix later.

- Switching to another algorithm when playing one causes the play button not to work for the first click
- Switching to another algorithm causing the speed slider not to display properly (gets reset to default, but slider isn't bound to that)
