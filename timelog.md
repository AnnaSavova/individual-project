## Guidance
* This file contains the time log for your project. It will be submitted along with your final dissertation.
* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

<hr>

## Total Time Spent (so far): 4 + 18.5 + 11 + 12.5 + 10 + 0.5 + 5.5 + 12 = **74 hours**
Current expected time spent (using 15 hours a week estimation - excluding week before being allocated project): 7 * 15 = **105 hours**
